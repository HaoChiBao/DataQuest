# DataQuest Hackathon - Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Introduction
Welcome to the DataQuest hackathon repository! Our team consisting of Xander Chin, Harvey Zhu, and Rachel Chen participated in this hackathon to build a machine learning model that could predict if a person would cancel their booking at a hotel. Our goal was to help the hotel reduce the number of cancellations and improve their revenue.

We used the Random Forest Classifier machine learning algorithm to train our model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and reduce overfitting. We also used feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize our model.
